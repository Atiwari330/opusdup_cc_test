# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following PNG icons:
- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)

## Temporary Solution
For testing, you can:
1. Open generate-icons.html in a browser
2. Right-click each canvas and save as PNG
3. Or use the icon.svg as a base to create PNGs using any image editor

## Design
The icon represents a microphone with sound waves, indicating audio transcription functionality. Uses the primary blue color (#3B82F6) from the EHR application.
